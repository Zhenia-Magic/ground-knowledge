# Ingestion prompt — one raw source → one KB delta

This is the **Ingestion layer** (Layer 1). It runs in Claude Code (or any Claude call):
given the current KB's entity tables plus one raw source, it emits a `delta.json` that
`src/epistemic.js add` folds into the KB. It is deliberately **single-source**: the cold
start is this prompt looped over discovered sources; an update is one run. Same path.

The prompt never invents IDs. It *proposes* links to existing entities, or marks something
`"NEW:<label>"`; the deterministic merge code decides. Keep extraction conservative —
every field that isn't clearly supported by the text should lower its `extractionConfidence`.

## System / instruction

````
You extract ONE source into a structured delta for an epistemic knowledge base.
You are given the case question and the KB's current entity tables. Output ONLY JSON
matching the schema below — no prose.

CASE QUESTION:
{{question}}

EXISTING POSITIONS (reuse an id when the source argues this stance; else "NEW:<label>"):
{{positions as id — label}}

EXISTING DATASETS (the underlying evidence bases; reuse an id when the source's data is
one of these; else "NEW:<label>". Prefer reuse — a shared cohort under a new name
defeats the independence audit):
{{datasets as id — label (aliases)}}

EXISTING FACTORS (dimensions the camps weigh; reference by exact label, or introduce a
new one only if the source genuinely raises a new dimension):
{{factors as label}}

EVIDENCE TYPES in use for this case (pick the closest; "NEW:<label>" only if none fit):
{{evidence vocabulary}}

POPULATIONS in use for this case (pick the closest; "NEW:<label>" for a new group; "—"
if not population-specific):
{{population vocabulary}}

SOURCE TO INGEST:
title, url, and full text / transcript / abstract:
{{source text}}

Rules (these exist to PREVENT entity proliferation — positions/datasets/factors/populations
multiplying via paraphrase as a case grows):
- position: REUSE an existing position whenever the source argues a stance already listed —
  even if worded differently or framed mechanistically. "NEW:<label>" only for a genuinely
  distinct claim. A mechanism (e.g. "IGF-1 raises risk") is a FACTOR, not a position. Keep the
  set small (~3-5); never create near-duplicates ("X increases risk" vs "mechanisms make X
  plausible").
- restsOn: the underlying PRIMARY evidence — named cohorts / trials / biobanks. A review or
  meta-analysis restsOn the cohorts it POOLS, NOT "the literature" / "studies through <year>" /
  a label describing the paper itself. Same cohort across sources => SAME label. If the cohorts
  aren't named, list the few largest you can identify, else leave restsOn empty.
- funding: inspect funding statement, affiliations, and COI disclosures. "industry" if any
  funder/affiliation has a commercial stake (trade groups, food/pharma; for reviews weigh
  author COI); else "independent".
- evidence: the closest EXISTING evidence type; "NEW:<label>" only if none fit.
- population: the studied human GROUP (region / menopausal status / age) — NOT the study design
  (that is `evidence`). Reuse a term; prefer broad buckets; "—" if not population-specific.
- confidence: the source's OWN stated strength (high/moderate/low/unstated), not yours.
- provenance: for position and restsOn, quote ONE COMPLETE verbatim sentence that states the
  actual finding/stance (direction of the association or the conclusion) + extractionConfidence
  [0,1]. The quote MUST be a whole sentence, not cut off mid-clause (never end on "associated
  with", "compared to", …). NEVER use the paper's title, a heading, or the search snippet. If only
  the title/abstract is available and no sentence states the finding, quote the closest complete
  statement and set extractionConfidence ≤ 0.4 — never the title.
- factorWeights: reuse a factor label VERBATIM (new only for a new dimension); for each factor
  the source bears on, how strongly its POSITION weights it (high/med/low) + quote + rationale.
- Do NOT fabricate. If the text doesn't support a field, omit it or mark low confidence.

See `cases/eggs.delta-zhuang2021.json` for a filled example. Feed the result to:

```
python cli.py add cases/eggs.kb.json delta.json
```

## Cold start (deep research), as orchestration

1. `python cli.py init eggs "Do eggs raise cardiovascular risk?" --out cases/eggs.kb.json`
2. Agent searches for sources bearing on the question and its sub-questions
   (`python cli.py discover` / `harvest`).
3. For each source: run this prompt → `delta.json` → `add`. The KB and every metric grow
   incrementally; the run is resumable and each `add` prints what the new source changed.
