"""Structured scholarly search (INGESTION, discovery side).

Find candidate sources for a research question via an open academic API (OpenAlex) instead of
an LLM web-search backend or publisher scraping. OpenAlex indexes 250M+ works, needs no key
(a contact email puts you in the faster "polite pool"), and returns title + DOI + year +
venue + citation count directly — so cold-start discovery works even with no LLM key at all.

Output matches the shape pipeline.discover() returns -- [{title, url, year, why}] -- so it is a
drop-in for the existing fetch -> label -> merge flow. Each candidate's url is its DOI, which
extract.py then resolves straight back through OpenAlex (abstract + funders), no scraping.
