_RULES = """Rules (apply to each source):
- relevance FIRST: does this source actually bear on THE QUESTION? If it is about a different
  topic (it neither studies the question's subject nor argues a stance on it), set
  "relevant": false and give a one-line "offTopicReason" — and do NOT invent a position, datasets,
  or factors for it. Only label sources that genuinely speak to the question. When in doubt and
  the source is clearly on-topic, set "relevant": true.
- position: the single stance the source takes ON THE QUESTION ASKED. REUSE an existing position
  whenever the source makes a stance already listed — even if worded differently or framed
  mechanistically. "NEW:<label>" only for a genuinely distinct claim. A mechanism (e.g. "IGF-1
  raises risk") is a FACTOR, not a position. Never create near-duplicates like "X increases risk"
  vs "mechanisms make X plausible".
  A study ABOUT the debate itself — how sources frame, fund, communicate, or bias the topic (e.g.
  "industry-funded orgs understate the risk") — is NOT a position. Assign it the stance it
  supports on the actual question (a framing critique that risks are understated supports the
  "harmful/cautious" position), and record the bias angle via funding and/or a factor — never as
  its own position camp.
- restsOn: the underlying PRIMARY evidence — named cohorts, trials, or biobanks (e.g. Nurses'
  Health Study, EPIC, a specific RCT). A review or meta-analysis restsOn the cohorts/trials it
  POOLS — NOT "the literature", "studies through <year>", or a label that just describes this
  paper. Use a short proper NAME (e.g. "Finnish Mobile Clinic cohort"), not an id-style slug or
  a name with sample sizes baked in. The same cohort across sources MUST use the SAME label. If
  the cohorts aren't named, list the few largest you can identify, else leave restsOn empty.
- funding: classify the funder from the funding/COI statement into ONE of: Industry, Advocacy,
  Government/public, Nonprofit/charity, Academic/institutional. Use "Undisclosed" if the text
  states no funding/COI — do NOT assume independence when it is silent.
- evidence: the closest EXISTING evidence type above; "NEW:<label>" only if none fit.
- population: the studied human GROUP (region, menopausal status, age band) — NOT the study
  design (that is "evidence"). Reuse an existing term; prefer broad buckets over hyper-specific
  ones; "—" if not population-specific.
- confidence: the source's OWN stated strength (high/moderate/low/unstated).
- provenance: quote the justifying span for position and restsOn + extractionConfidence [0,1].
- factorWeights: reuse a factor label VERBATIM (new only for a genuinely new dimension); for each
  factor the source bears on, how strongly its POSITION weights it (high/med/low) + quote +
  one-line rationale.
- Do NOT fabricate. If the text doesn't support a field, omit it or mark low confidence."""
