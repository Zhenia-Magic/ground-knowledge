_RULES = """Rules (apply to each source):
- relevance FIRST: does this source actually bear on THE QUESTION — its specific EXPOSURE *and*
  its specific OUTCOME? Match BOTH. A source on a different OUTCOME is off-topic even if the exposure
  is right: for "…reduce CARDIOVASCULAR risk?", a study reporting only ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY, cancer,
  a different disease, or heavy-use harm (e.g. alcoholic cardiomyopathy) does NOT address the
  cardiovascular question unless it directly reports cardiovascular outcomes. If it is off-topic,
  set "relevant": false with a one-line "offTopicReason" and do NOT invent a position, datasets, or
  factors. Only label sources that speak to the question's exposure AND outcome.
- position: the single DIRECTIONAL stance the source takes ON THE QUESTION — an actual answer to it
  (e.g. increases / decreases / no clear effect / it depends). REUSE an existing position whenever
  the source argues a stance already listed, even if worded differently. "NEW:<label>" only for a
  genuinely distinct directional answer; keep the whole set small (~3-5).
  LITMUS: if you cannot phrase it as an answer to the question, it is NOT a position — it is a FACTOR.
  These are FACTORS, never positions, even when the paper is mostly about them: a mechanism / pathway
  ("IGF-1 raises risk", "receptor genetics modulate MI susceptibility"); a biomarker or surrogate
  ("raises LDL"); a subgroup / moderator / susceptibility factor (diabetics, a gene variant); or a
  meta / framing / funding observation ("industry-funded orgs understate the risk"). For ANY of these,
  assign the source the closest existing position its overall direction supports — or the most neutral
  "no clear effect / it depends" camp if it takes no directional stance on the question — and record
  the specific mechanism / biomarker / subgroup / framing angle as a factorWeight. Do NOT mint a new
  position camp for it.
  ONE camp per direction: do not split a stance into several positions by its CONDITIONS (e.g. two
  "conditionally safe" camps — one for scar status, one for elective timing). Use a SINGLE "it
  depends / conditionally" position and capture each differing condition as a FACTOR. If a new
  position label would share its stance word with an existing one (both "safe", both "increases"),
  reuse that position instead. The label states ONLY the direction — never a parenthetical or
  qualifier like "(after bias adjustment)", "(short-term)", "(with caveats)"; that condition is a
  FACTOR. "No clear effect (after adjustment)" and "No clear effect" are the SAME position.
- restsOn: the underlying PRIMARY evidence — named cohorts, trials, or biobanks (e.g. Nurses'
  Health Study, EPIC, a specific RCT). A review or meta-analysis restsOn the cohorts/trials it
  POOLS — NOT "the literature", "studies through <year>", or a label that just describes this
  paper. Use a short proper NAME (e.g. "Finnish Mobile Clinic cohort"), not an id-style slug or
  a name with sample sizes baked in. The same cohort across sources MUST use the SAME label. If
  the cohorts aren't named, list the few largest you can identify, else leave restsOn empty.
  restsOn may ALSO point at ANOTHER SOURCE when this source's case IS that source — a commentary
  whose evidence is one paper, or two pieces citing each other. Write "SRC:<existing source id>"
  (see SOURCES ALREADY IN THE KB) or "NEW-SRC:<exact title>". This is how echo and circular
  citation are detected, so name the real source rather than inventing a vague dataset for it.
- funding: classify the funder from the funding/COI statement into ONE of: Industry, Advocacy,
  Government/public, Nonprofit/charity, Academic/institutional. Use "Undisclosed" if the text
  states no funding/COI — do NOT assume independence when it is silent.
- SOURCE TYPE: a PRESS RELEASE, newsroom page, news/magazine article, or encyclopedia entry (e.g.
  a university news page, Wikipedia) is NEVER primary evidence — it only reports on a study. Label
  it "Narrative/Commentary" and put the STUDY it describes in restsOn via SRC:/NEW-SRC:, never a
  dataset. Only the study/report ITSELF is primary. A court opinion is likewise not scientific
  evidence for an empirical question — treat it as commentary, not a data source.
- evidence: the closest EXISTING evidence type above; "NEW:<label>" only if none fit.
- population: the studied GROUP (region, menopausal status, age band) — NOT the study design (that
  is "evidence"). Reuse an existing term; prefer broad buckets; "—" if not population-specific.
  If the study is NOT in humans, say so here: use "Mice", "Rats", "Animal model", or "In vitro /
  cell" — never leave an animal or cell study looking like human evidence; that distinction is the
  whole point of the population tag for a clinical question.
- confidence: the source's OWN stated strength (high/moderate/low/unstated).
- provenance: for position and restsOn, quote ONE COMPLETE verbatim sentence from the text that
  states the actual FINDING/stance (the direction of the association or the conclusion) +
  extractionConfidence [0,1]. The quote MUST be a whole sentence, not cut off mid-clause (never
  end on "associated with", "compared to", etc.). NEVER quote the paper's title, a heading, the
  search snippet, or a METADATA / BOILERPLATE line — publication dates ("Accepted for Publication:
  …"), author lists, "a literature search was conducted from …", "this review summarises …" — these
  state no finding. If the fetched text genuinely contains no sentence stating the finding (e.g. only
  metadata came through), set extractionConfidence ≤ 0.3 and quote the closest real statement, or
  leave the quote empty — never pad it with boilerplate.
- Quote RELEVANCE, not just quote presence: the quote must directly support the SPECIFIC position
  assigned, not merely be a true, well-formed sentence from the paper. Do not stretch a tangential
  or partial finding to justify a position it does not actually state. If, after reading the whole
  text, no passage genuinely states this source's stance on the question, do not force a
  best-guess position with a weak or loosely-related quote — reconsider "relevant": false instead
  (see the relevance rule above). A position asserted with no real textual grounding is a worse
  outcome than a source correctly marked off-topic; when genuinely torn between a weak position
  and off-topic, prefer off-topic and say why in offTopicReason.
- factorWeights: a factor is a DIMENSION THE CAMPS DISAGREE ON (a crux) — e.g. "weight given to
  industry funding", "how much to discount observational confounding", "biomarkers vs hard
  outcomes". It is NOT a study parameter, subgroup, measured outcome, or topic (gestational age,
  parity, sample size, cesarean rate, dose: those DESCRIBE a study, they are not where camps
  disagree — skip them). Name the DIMENSION, never a specific value: "Gestational age at induction",
  NOT "...(39 weeks)" — the number belongs in the quote. REUSE an existing factor label VERBATIM
  whenever this source bears on it; add a new factor only for a genuinely new AXIS OF DISAGREEMENT.
  Litmus: a real factor is one MORE THAN ONE camp would weigh (differently) — if only one side
  could ever engage it, it's a descriptive tag, not a crux, so don't add it. For each factor the
  source bears on: how strongly its POSITION weights it (high/med/low) + quote + one-line rationale.
- Do NOT fabricate. If the text doesn't support a field, omit it or mark low confidence."""
