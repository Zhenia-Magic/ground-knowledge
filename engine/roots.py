"""Root-basis resolution — the engine behind the independence metric (see MECHANISM.md).

Resolves every source to the primary EVIDENTIARY ROOTS it ultimately depends on, by following
`restsOn` edges (to datasets AND to other sources), collapsing strongly-connected citation cycles
(circular corroboration) to a single root, and falling back to evidence-tier defaults for ungrounded
sources. Pure functions of the KB; deterministic; no side effects.

Root keys produced:
    ds:<id>          a real dataset / cohort / experiment
    prim:<sourceId>  an ungrounded PRIMARY source — its own root (benefit of the doubt)
    secpool:<posId>  the single 'ungrounded secondary' voice for a position (all echo collapses here)
    cycle:<sourceId> a circular-corroboration loop with no primary grounding (flagged)
