Pure, deterministic functions over a knowledge base (KB). No LLM, no I/O, stdlib only.
Adding evidence never re-runs these by hand on old data -- they just recount, so recompute
is O(whole KB) but cheap, while ingestion stays O(new sources). This is the single
implementation of every number the tool reports; the viewer renders these outputs, it does
not recompute them, so there is no drift between pipeline and UI.
